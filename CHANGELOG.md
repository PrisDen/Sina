### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements

#### 🚨 **Major Issues Resolved**
- **Fixed UnboundLocalError in Focus Route**

  - Solution: Renamed all conflicting variables (`session_data` → `focus_stats`, etc.)
  - Impact: Focus page now fully functional

- **Fixed DateTime ValueError in Tasks Route**
  - Root cause: HTML datetime-local inputs produce ISO format, code expected SQLite format
  - Solution: Implemented flexible datetime parser supporting multiple formats
  - Impact: Tasks page now handles all datetime formats gracefully

- **Fixed CDN 403 Forbidden Errors**
  - Root cause: External CDN resources (Tailwind, Font Awesome, Google Fonts) occasionally blocked
  - Solution: Added error handling and comprehensive fallback CSS styles
  - Impact: Application works reliably even when CDNs fail

#### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Robust datetime parsing for ISO and SQLite formats
- Improved variable naming conventions to avoid Flask conflicts
- Added comprehensive fallback styles for offline functionality

#### 📋 **Known Issues Identified**
